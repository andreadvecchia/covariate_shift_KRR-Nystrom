The goal is to study **covariate shift**â€”the setting where train and test input distributions differ while the conditional distribution (and then also the target regression function) remains the same â€”and to evaluate **importance-weighted** Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) alongside its **NystrÃ¶m** efficient and scalable approximation.

**Why this matters.** Classical KRR can deliver optimal statistical guarantees in RKHSs, but its \(\mathcal{O}(n^3)\) time / \(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\) memory costs limit scalability. Under covariate shift, we must also correct for the distribution mismatch, typically via **importance weighting (IW)**. This notebook examines whether **random subspace methods (NystrÃ¶m)** preserve accuracy *while* reducing compute under distribution shift.

> **Takeaway.** Following the paper, the NystrÃ¶m-accelerated, importance-weighted estimator targets **the same statistical accuracy** as the full IW-KRRâ€”*with far better computational profile*â€”provided the subspace size is chosen appropriately.

**What youâ€™ll find here.**
A simulation setting with controlled **train/test Gaussian distribution shift**.
Three models:
- **KRR** (vanilla)
- **IWâ€“KRR** (importance-weighted)
- **IWâ€“NystrÃ¶m KRR** (importance-weighted with NystrÃ¶m compression via BLESS)
- A **clean results summary** comparing mean test MSE and execution time across multiple runs.

The project includes both a clean **Jupyter notebook** and an **installable Python package** with a CLI.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .
# (optional for 3D plot) 
pip install -e .[plot]
```

## Quick run

Use the console entry-point to run a short comparison with cross-validated hyperparameters and 5 random seeds:

```bash
covshift-compare
```

or directly:

```bash
python scripts/compare_models.py
```

## Package layout

```

  __init__.py
  core.py      # config, sampling, models, CV, training, CLI
  plot.py      # optional 3D visualization (requires matplotlib)
  bless.py     # lightweight BLESS routine (vendored)
scripts/
  compare_models.py  # calls into covshift.core
```
